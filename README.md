# NewsPortal-using-newsAPI
-This is a small project based on website integration with APIs.
-This project uses Vite for reactjs.
-These are the libraries that I used in my project :
React
Redux Toolkit
React Redux
React Router DOM
Axios
Vite
NewsAPI
-Install the latest version of Nodejs.
-The API key may be expired but you can use your own by signing in at any opensource platform (I used NewsAPI).
-Replace the key in the .env, api.js, and articleSlice.js files.
